# Agent instructions — QUICD

This repository is developed under the [Open Session License](./OPEN-SESSION-LICENSE.md)
(session-transparency terms, in addition to the code license in `LICENSE`).
AI agents working in this repo MUST:

1. **Append every turn** (each user message and each model response, verbatim) to
   `llm-turn-history.jsonl` as you work, in open-session-jsonl v0.4 format: one
   `{"id": "<ULID>", "m": "<speaker>", "t": "<text>", "ts": "<ISO-8601 UTC ms>",
   "s": "<session sid>"}` record per turn, plus optional `"x"` tool-activity
   summary on model turns.
2. **Never read the history file** — not even its last line. Appending needs no read:
   stamp a fresh ULID `id` and `ts` and append. Its purpose is human curiosity and
   replication, not machine context.
3. **Never edit or delete past records.** The file is append-only; corrections are made
   by appending.
4. **Declare sessions**: at session start append a session record
   `{"session": "<ISO date>", "tool": "<harness>", "sid": "<fresh ULID>",
   "name": "<optional agent/channel label>", "speakers": {...}}` declaring each
   participating human and model (name + model id). Stamp the same `sid` as
   `"s"` on every turn you append in that session; in multiagent setups each
   agent declares its own session (its own `sid` + `name`) so readers can
   surface channels separately.
5. **Honor union merges**: `.gitattributes` sets `merge=union` for the history file;
   readers order by `(ts, id)` and dedupe by `id`. Never "fix" its physical line order.
